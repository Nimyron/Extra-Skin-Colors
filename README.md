This is a very simple mod for Rimwolrd which adds genes with extra skin colors.



How to add your own skin colors :

* Go to Defs/GeneDefs/ and open ExtraSkinColors.xml
* Copy-paste the <GeneDef> section (select from <GeneDef> to </GeneDef>)
* Modify <defName>, <label>, <labelShortAdj>, <description>, <skinColorOverride>, and add 10 to <displayOrderInCategory>
* Save and reload your game, your new skin color should appear in the xenotype editor
