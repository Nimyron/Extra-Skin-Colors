<!-- Side note : This mod only adds new skin colors. If you want to override existing skin colors from the base game or other mods, you'll have to look into patching with harmony.
				 Creating a new skin color with the same defName as another one from a mod will either work or return an error (not sure which) but either way it's not good practice. -->
